WildHacks 2014: Pickpocket
===========
[Pickpocket](https://pickpocket.herokuapp.com) is a scheduling application to help you read what you've bookmarked. Pickpocket is especially geared towards college students, who may have awkward blocks of free time in between their classes. Instead of killing an hour or two on Facebook, use Pickpocket to catch up on some reading.

After authorizing both your Pocket and Google accounts, you can see a random selection of your previously Pocketed articles scheduled for you to read in [this Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/render#g%7Cweek-2+22903+22909+22903).

Pickpocket is a Sinatra app built using the pocket-ruby gem and Google Calendar API.
